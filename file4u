How can I get nexus swarms to view my screen live like a video but can see what I’m trying to do when I need help
or something?
I wanna build crazy physical devices and robots with Claude code who are all connected to nexus
Have Claude code constantly optimize itself to all its latest updates and relevant updates in the field and teach
me how to use them if needed for me to know. Actually a cheap smart model
To operate from an elite strategic position in 2026, you shouldn't just look for "chatbots." You need Inference
Engines—APIs that provide massive volume and specialized logic. Here are the top 15 AI APIs with the most
generous free tiers (high rate limits) and unique "special abilities" that differentiate them from general-purpose
tools. 1. Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Series) * The "Lot": Up to 1,000 requests per day (Flash-Lite) and 15
requests per minute. * Special Ability: Massive Context (1M - 2M tokens). It can "read" a 1,000-page PDF or 10
hours of video in a single prompt. No one else offers this much "short-term memory" for free. * Best For:
Analyzing entire business quarters or complex legal archives. 2. Groq (Llama 3.3 & Mixtral) * The "Lot": Extremely
high Rate Limits (thousands of tokens per minute). * Special Ability: Instantaneous Speed (300+ tokens/sec). It is
the fastest inference engine on the planet. * Best For: Real-time translation, high-frequency trade analysis, or any
situation where a 2-second delay is a failure. 3. DeepSeek (DeepSeek-R1 / V3) * The "Lot": 1 to 3 Million free
tokens per month on their free tier. * Special Ability: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning. Their R1 model is
arguably the smartest logic model for math and coding, rivaling GPT-4o but focused purely on logical deduction. *
Best For: Solving impossible-to-debug code or high-stakes mathematical logic. 4. Mistral AI (La Plateforme) *
The "Lot": 1 request per second (RPS). That is 3,600 requests per hour—effectively infinite for a single person. *
Special Ability: European Regulatory Intelligence. Mistral models are optimized for European languages and
nuances, often outperforming US models in multi-lingual reasoning. * Best For: Multi-lingual negotiations and
cross-border strategic planning. 5. Cerebras (Llama 3.1 & 3.3) * The "Lot": 30 requests per minute (over 43,000
requests/day). * Special Ability: Wafer-Scale Inference. Like Groq, it is optimized for speed, but they offer access
to the massive 405B Llama models for free, which are "GPT-4 level" in intelligence. * Best For: Running the
"smartest" open-source models at high speed. 6. Sambanova Cloud * The "Lot": High throughput on Llama 3 and
Qwen models. * Special Ability: Full Precision Inference. Many free APIs "compress" (quantize) models to save
money. Sambanova runs them at full precision, meaning the AI is slightly "smarter" and more accurate than other
free providers. * Best For: High-stakes accuracy where "hallucination" is a fatal risk. 7. OpenRouter (Free Models)
* The "Lot": Access to a "Free Models" library that aggregates 20+ different LLMs. * Special Ability: Dynamic
Routing. It’s one API that connects to everything. If one provider goes down, you just switch models in the same
code. * Best For: Building robust systems that can't afford a single point of failure. 8. SiliconFlow * The "Lot": A
unified API offering high-performance serverless inference. * Special Ability: Latency Dominance. They claim
2.3x faster speeds than traditional cloud providers. * Best For: Developers building "lag-free" agentic
applications. 9. Qwen (Alibaba) * The "Lot": 200+ Agent requests per day and massive token quotas for their V3
models. * Special Ability: Agentic Reasoning. Qwen is specifically trained to use tools (search the web, call other
APIs) better than almost any other open model. * Best For: Automating web-based research or "agentic"
workflows. 10. Together AI * The "Lot": $25 in free credits upon sign-up (covers millions of tokens). * Special
1/22/26, 3 52 AM
Page 1 of 5Ability: Model Variety. They host everything from Llama 4 to specialized medical and coding models
(CodeLlama). * Best For: "Hot-swapping" models to find the perfect logic for a specific task. 11. Cloudflare
Workers AI * The "Lot": Free for up to 10,000 requests per day for certain models. * Special Ability: Edge
Deployment. The AI runs on Cloudflare's servers closest to your physical location, reducing network lag to nearly
zero. * Best For: Global applications where you need the AI to be "everywhere" at once. 12. Hugging Face
Serverless * The "Lot": Free access to 100,000+ models for "light to medium" workloads. * Special Ability:
Hyper-Specialization. Need an AI that only does "Legal Text in 18th Century English"? You can find it and call it
via API here. * Best For: Niche, technical domain tasks that general models (like ChatGPT) fail at. 13. Fireworks AI
* The "Lot": Generous free tier for their "Serverless" endpoints. * Special Ability: Elite Quantization. They use
advanced techniques to make large models (like 405B) run on smaller hardware without losing their "IQ." * Best
For: High-intelligence tasks on a budget. 14. Blackbox AI * The "Lot": Extremely high daily limits for coding-
specific queries. * Special Ability: Real-time Web Search + Code. It can search the latest GitHub commits and
documentation to answer questions about libraries that were released this morning. * Best For: Software
engineering and technical problem-solving. 15. Perplexity (Sonar API) * The "Lot": Access to their "Sonar" models
via API (often through credits or developer trials). * Special Ability: Fact-Checking Engine. Unlike other LLMs that
guess, Perplexity is built to search the web first and synthesize an answer with citations. * Best For: Verifying
claims and gathering real-world data in real-time. Comparison of the "Big Three" Strategies: | Strategy | Best
Provider | Why? | |---|---|---| | Data Mastery | Google AI Studio | 2M context window handles "The Big Picture."
| | Logic/Reasoning | DeepSeek | R1 model is a logic specialist. | | Speed/Volume | Groq / Mistral | Highest
"requests per second" for constant chatting. | Would you like me to write a script that connects to one of these
(e.g., Gemini or Groq) so you can start using your high-volume API today?

1/22/26, 3 52 AM
Page 2 of 5In the 2026 landscape, "smartness" for coding isn't just about syntax; it's about Context-Aware Reasoning (the
ability to see your whole project) and Inference Efficiency. If you want "a LOT" of chats without hitting a wall, you
need to look at providers that subsidize their APIs to gain developer market share. Here is the strategic ranking of
the top 10 cheapest/free coding AI APIs based on Reasoning-to-Cost Efficiency. 1. DeepSeek (DeepSeek-V3 /
R1) DeepSeek has completely disrupted the market by offering "reasoning" models that rival GPT-4o but at
1/50th of the cost. * The "Lot": They often give 2–5 million tokens for free to start, and their paid tier is so cheap
($0.20 per 1M tokens) that $5 will last a developer months of high-volume use. * Coding Ability: Their R1 model
uses "Chain-of-Thought" reasoning, meaning it explains its logic before writing the code—essential for complex
architecture. 2. Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Flash) * The "Lot": Up to 1,500 requests per day and a staggering 1
million token context window for free. * Coding Ability: This is the only free API that can "read" your entire
codebase (30,000+ lines) in one go to find a bug or refactor a system. It is the king of "Repo-level"
understanding. 3. Puter.js (Qwen 2.5 Coder / Qwen 3) * The "Lot": Puter provides a "User-Pays" bridge that
currently allows unlimited free access to the Qwen family of models. * Coding Ability: Qwen 2.5 Coder is widely
considered the best open-source coding model. It outperforms Llama in Python and C++ benchmarks and is
highly "agentic" (great at using tools). 4. Mistral AI (Codestral) * The "Lot": Their "Experiment" tier allows for
consistent, free access (approx. 1 request per second). * Coding Ability: Codestral is a specialist model. It was
trained specifically on 80+ programming languages. It excels at "Fill-In-the-Middle" (FIM), which is the logic used
for real-time autocomplete in IDEs like VS Code. 5. Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) * The "Lot": Extremely high Rate Limits
(RPM). It’s not "unlimited tokens," but the frequency of chats allowed is much higher than OpenAI or Anthropic. *
Coding Ability: Speed. Groq is so fast (300+ tokens/sec) that it makes the coding experience feel like a live
conversation. Best for quick boilerplate and unit tests. 6. SiliconFlow * The "Lot": One of the cheapest providers
globally ($0.05–$0.08 per 1M tokens). * Coding Ability: They host DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen-Coder at "full
precision," meaning the model isn't "dumbed down" to save server space. You get the smartest version of the
model for pennies. 7. Blackbox AI * The "Lot": Very aggressive free tier specifically for the coding community. *
Coding Ability: It has a "Real-time Web Search" feature built into the coding API. If you’re using a library that was
updated yesterday, Blackbox can find the new documentation, whereas most LLMs would hallucinate the old
version. 8. Together AI * The "Lot": They provide $25 in free credits upon sign-up. Because their models (like
Llama 4 Scout) are so cheap, $25 can easily cover 10 million+ tokens. * Coding Ability: Huge variety. You can
"hot-swap" between 50 different coding models to see which one handles your specific framework (React, Rust,
etc.) most accurately. 9. OpenRouter (Free Library) * The "Lot": A unified API that aggregates all "Free" models
from other providers into one list. * Coding Ability: It allows you to build a coding agent that never "dies"—if one
free provider goes down, OpenRouter automatically switches you to another free coding model. 10. Cerebras
(Llama 3.1 405B) * The "Lot": High-volume free tier for their "Wafer-Scale" inference. * Coding Ability: It gives
you free access to Llama 405B, the largest open-source model. It has the raw "IQ" to handle high-stakes logic
that smaller models (like 8B or 70B) fail to grasp. Strategy Comparison: Coding Logic vs. Context | Strategy | API
to Use | Why? | |---|---|---| | Full Repo Analysis | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Can see 1M tokens of code at once. | | Hard
Logic / Debugging | DeepSeek-R1 | Uses "Thinking" mode to solve math/logic. | | Daily High-Volume Work |
Puter.js (Qwen) | Unlimited free requests for standard tasks. | Would you like me to generate a specific API
integration script for any of these so you can test their coding "IQ" yourself?

Page 3 of 5To achieve true "headless" automation on iOS (where the AI works in the background without opening an app),
you shouldn't use the standard apps. You should use the "Get Contents of URL" action in Shortcuts to talk directly
to their APIs. Here is the strategic ranking of the top 10 free AI APIs for iOS Shortcuts in 2026, ranked by Rate
Limits, Reliability, and Ease of "Headless" Integration: 1. Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Flash) This is the gold
standard for free automation. Google provides a massive daily quota to entice developers. * The "Lot": 1,500
requests per day and 15 requests per minute. * Special Ability: Massive Context. You can have a Shortcut that
"scrapes" a long article or your entire day’s calendar and sends the whole thing to Gemini for a summary in one
go. * iOS Vibe: Very easy to parse its JSON response in Shortcuts. 2. OpenRouter (Free Tier) OpenRouter is a
"unified" API. You get one API key that lets you access multiple free models (Llama 3.3, Mistral, Gemma 2, etc.). *
The "Lot": They aggregate over 18+ completely free models. If one model hits a limit, you just change the model
ID in your Shortcut and keep going. * Special Ability: Model Diversity. You can use specialized coding models (like
Devstral 2) or reasoning models (like DeepSeek-R1) all via the same URL. * iOS Vibe: Use the model ID suffix :free
to ensure you never get billed. 3. GroqCloud If your Shortcut needs to feel "instant" (e.g., a voice-to-text reply),
Groq is the winner. * The "Lot": High RPM (Requests Per Minute) limits. While they have daily token caps, the
speed is the real draw. * Special Ability: Latency. It generates text at 300+ tokens per second. Your Shortcut will
finish running before you even lock your phone. * iOS Vibe: Best for "Hey Siri" triggers where you don't want to
wait 5 seconds for a response. 4. Cloudflare Workers AI Cloudflare is an infrastructure giant. Their free tier for AI
is designed for high-volume background tasks. * The "Lot": Up to 10,000 free neurons (requests) per day on their
Free plan. * Special Ability: Edge Execution. Since it runs on Cloudflare's global network, the "path" from your
iPhone to the AI is extremely short, making it highly reliable on cellular data. * iOS Vibe: Incredible for small,
repetitive tasks like "Categorize this receipt" or "Translate this clipboard text." 5. Mistral AI (La Plateforme) Mistral
is the pride of European AI and offers a very stable "Experiment" tier. * The "Lot": 1 request per second. That’s
3,600 chats per hour. It’s nearly impossible to hit this limit as a single user. * Special Ability: Efficiency. Their
"Mistral Small" and "Codestral" models are incredibly dense and follow complex instructions better than most
large models. * iOS Vibe: Very clean API documentation makes it easy to set up the Dictionary headers in
Shortcuts. 6. DeepSeek (Official API) The "Logic King" of 2026. DeepSeek-R1 is the model everyone uses for
hard reasoning. * The "Lot": They frequently give out millions of free tokens to new users. For automation, a
million tokens can last for thousands of Shortcut runs. * Special Ability: Chain-of-Thought. You can tell the
Shortcut to "Think deeply before answering," and it will perform complex logic (math/coding) in the background.
7. Sambanova Cloud * The "Lot": Generous free access to Meta’s massive Llama 405B model. * Special Ability:
Full Precision. While other free APIs use "compressed" models, Sambanova runs them at full strength. It is the
"smartest" free Llama access you can get. 8. Together AI * The "Lot": $25 in free credits upon sign-up. In the
world of cheap APIs, $25 is effectively "infinite" for personal Shortcuts (roughly 10–20 million tokens). * Special
Ability: Specialist Models. Access to niche models like Upstage (for OCR/Document reading) or StripedHyena. 9.
Cerebras Cloud * The "Lot": Massive throughput limits. * Special Ability: High-Volume Llama. If you have a
Shortcut that needs to run every 5 minutes (like a news monitor or price tracker), Cerebras handles that frequency
better than anyone. 10. Hugging Face Serverless * The "Lot": Free for "Reasonable use" across 100,000+
models. * Special Ability: The "Anything" API. Want an AI that only summarizes YouTube transcripts? Or one that
only detects the tone of an email? You can find a tiny, specialized model here and call it for free. How to use these
in Shortcuts (The "Elite" Method) To never open an app, follow this pattern in the Shortcuts App: * Action:
Dictionary (Put your API Key and Prompt here). * Action: Get Contents of URL (Set to POST). * URL: Use the API
endpoint (e.g., https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/...). * Headers: Add Content-Type: application/json
and Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY. * Action: Get Value from Dictionary (To grab the AI's text from the messy
JSON response). Would you like me to provide the exact JSON body and URL for the Gemini API (#1) so you can
paste it into a Shortcut right now?
Max the hell out of Gemini and the others

reasoning ($0.14/M tokens) ∙ Claude API for complex analysis ($3/M tokens) ∙ n8n cloud for automation (free
tier)
Use DeepSeek API instead: $0.14 per million tokens for reasoning, $0.27 for chat. Way cheaper than upgrading
hardware.

Page 1 of 4iFuse (libimobiledevice) can mount your iPhone’s file system and allow you to write files from Linux. The problem?
These files won’t show up anywhere useful on the iPhone – not in the Files app, not in Photos, not in any media
app. Best used for pulling photos/videos OFF the iPhone. KDE Connect (Limited iOS Support) KDE Connect has
made great strides in Linux-to-Android file transfers, but iOS support is a different story. With the official KDE
Connect app from the App Store, you’ll find that file transfers are one-way only, and even then, heavily restricted.
You can pull files from the iPhone to Linux (sometimes), but you can’t push files to the iPhone. Pushcut —
Webhook Bridge Use it for notifying me of events on Linux server, like a site update deployment. There are myriad
possibilities. Your Linux server can trigger iOS shortcuts via HTTP webhooks using Pushcut’s API.
ifuse — Mount iPhone on Linux (USB) Install the ifuse package. You can then run the following command to
mount your iPhone’s media filesystem. You can use this to access the device’s photos inside mountpoint/DCIM.
LocalSend — The AirDrop for Everything LocalSend uses your local WiFi network to transfer files. Your data never
leaves your local network. All transfers are encrypted using HTTPS. LocalSend is available for Windows, macOS,
Linux, Android, and iOS. No account, no login, no servers. The app works as a cross-platform tool for transferring
files between devices, offering functionality similar to Apple’s AirDrop but without being limited to a single
ecosystem. It works across just about every platform out there including Android, iOS, iPad OS, Windows, Mac
and Linux.
Webhook Triggers for Remote Automation Execute an iOS shortcut from a HomeKit automation. Convert your
HomeKit automation into a shortcut and use the Get Contents of URL action to run a ‘real’ shortcut on your iOS
server. Trigger smart notifications from Shortcuts, HomeKit, schedules, locations, iBeacons, online services (like
IFTTT, Zapier, Flow, Integromat), home servers, or anywhere that knows what HTTP is. NFC Tag Automation As a
Shortcuts user I like to automate more stuff to make sure I can switch on or off things in the easiest way possible.
For that, I needed to use NFC tags and connect some additional lights to Apple Home using the app called
Homebridge. Buy cheap NFC stickers, program them to trigger shortcuts when you tap your phone against them.

GitOps + Infrastructure as Code Make your server/cluster deployment reproducible. Don’t rely on fancy web UIs but rather
configuration files. Use Ansible, Terraform, or Flux to define your entire lab in code. 16. K3s Kubernetes (If You Want to Go
Deep) For container orchestration, the split is clear: Docker Compose for simplicity, K3S for those who want Kubernetes
without the complexity. 17. Backup Strategy (3-2-1 Rule) Proxmox Backup Server + off-site replication. Your photos, configs,
and data need protection.

This will save you a lot of headaches. Pi-hole/AdGuard Home — DNS Sinkhole Network-wide ad blocking. Your
iPhone benefits from this when on home WiFi. Proper Network Segmentation My Pi-hole doesn’t need to be on
the same machine as my test containers, which also shouldn’t be alongside my NAS in the same VLAN.
Completely separating experimentation and services I rely on is a good start.
Nextcloud — File Sync + Productivity Nextcloud remains the productivity backbone for most homelabs, but the
way people use it has evolved. It’s no longer just file sync.

iOS 26 Developer Mode — Unlock System Access iOS 26 Developer Mode stands out as the safest and most
flexible way to install IPA files, access developer settings, and customize your iPhone’s system performance. You
can safely sideload apps, test beta builds, and use debugging tools without jailbreaking. To enable: Go to Settings
→ Privacy & Security → Developer Mode, toggle it on, restart your device. Sideloading Methods
AltStore/Sideloadly (Free Apple ID): Apps need re-signing every 7 days, but tools like AltStore can automate
iPhone/Watch Widget: Use a Python script to poll the Home Assistant API.
The iPhone Side (Scriptable) Use the Scriptable app to create custom iOS home screen widgets that show Ubuntu stats. •
The Workflow: Run a simple FastAPI (Python) script on Ubuntu that listens for requests. Scriptable on your iPhone makes a
GET request to your laptop’s IP (via Tailscale) to fetch CPU load, RAM usage, and active Hyprland workspace. 4. The 2026
"OP" Automation Logic • Auto-Lock by Proximity: Set up a script on Ubuntu that pings your iPhone’s IP (via Tailscale). If the
ping latency exceeds 50ms (meaning you walked away), Hyprland triggers hyprlock automatically. • Apple Watch
"Terminal": Use the Blink Shell app on your Watch. In 2026, it supports basic "Trigger" buttons. You can restart a stuck
process on Ubuntu by tapping your wrist. • AirPods Audio-Switch: Use PipeWire's wireplumber on Ubuntu to detect when
your AirPods connect. Have it automatically switch your default output and send a notification to your iPhone saying
"Ubuntu Audio Hijacked."
.
1. The Core: Performance & Window Management To make Ubuntu feel "OP," you need to bypass the standard GNOME shell
for Hyprland. • Kernel: Swap the generic kernel for Liquorix or XanMod. • Reason: These are optimized for low-latency
desktop use and will make Hyprland’s animations and window switching feel instantaneous. • Window Manager: Hyprland
(Wayland). • On Ubuntu, don't use the standard repos; use the Hyprland-Ubt automated build scripts (popular in 2026) to
ensure all dependencies are handled. • Status Bar: Waybar. • You’ll use Waybar as your data hub, showing your iPhone and
Apple Watch battery alongside your CPU/GPU vitals. 2. The Connectivity Bridge (The Glue) To get "Full Control," you need
to bridge the Apple-Linux divide using two specific tools: A. KDE Connect (iOS + Linux) This is the single most important
tool for an iPhone-Ubuntu user. • Widgets: You get a "Remote Commands" widget on your iPhone. • Control: Map
commands like hyprctl dispatch exit (Close Hyprland) or systemctl suspend to buttons on your iPhone and Apple Watch. •
Clipboard: Copy a bash script on your Ubuntu terminal, paste it directly into your iPhone notes. B. Home Assistant (Self-
Hosted on Ubuntu) You don't need fancy smart home gear; you are using this to pull Apple Sensors. 1. Install Home
Assistant in a Docker container on your Ubuntu laptop. 2. Install the Home Assistant Companion App on your iPhone and
Watch. 3. The Result: Your iPhone will now send its battery %, Focus Mode (Do Not Disturb), and Apple Watch battery %
directly to your Ubuntu machine via a local API. 3. The Widget Stack: Cross-Device Sync This is what you specifically asked
for—widgets that talk to each other. The Linux Side (Eww + Waybar) Use Eww (Elkowar’s Wacky Widgets) for a "floating"
glass dashboard. AirPods Widget: Use AirStatus (Python CLI). It scans BLE beacons to find your AirPods' charge levels
(Left, Right, Case) and displays them in a clean table or Waybar tooltip.
1/22/26, 3 53 AM
Page 3 of 4The Command & Control Workflow
1. Focus Mode Sync: When you flip your iPhone 12 to "Work" Focus, Home Assistant detects the state change and sends a
webhook to your Linux machine. Hyprland automatically changes your wallpaper, launches your IDE, and silences
notifications. 2. Watch Triggers: You can create a "Lock Laptop" button on your Apple Watch. Tapping it sends a command
via KDE Connect to execute hyprlock. 3. AirPods Auto-Switch: Use a script that detects when your AirPods MAC address
connects to your phone; it can automatically pause media on Linux or vice-versa using playerctl.
The Widget Stack
This is how you get the cross-device battery and status syncing you requested. A. Linux Desktop Widgets (Eww + Waybar)
Don't just use a bar; use Eww (Elkowar’s Wacky Widgets). It’s written in Rust and allows for highly styled, interactive CSS
widgets. • iPhone/Watch Battery on Linux: Write a simple bash script that curls the Home Assistant API to get your iPhone
12's battery level and outputs it to an Eww widget or a Waybar module. • AirPods Battery: In 2026, use pipewire-airpods-
battery scripts. Since AirPods don't use standard Bluetooth Battery Service, these scripts scan BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)
beacons to grab the % of each bud and the case. B. iPhone/Watch Widgets (Scriptable) • Tool: Scriptable (iOS App). • The
Setup: Write a JavaScript snippet in Scriptable that polls your Linux laptop's status (CPU temp, RAM, Uptime) via an SSH
command (using Blink Shell integration) or a simple Python http.server. • Result: A native iOS widget on your iPhone 12
home screen showing your Linux laptop's real-time "vitals."
Hyprland
HA 2026 now features Matter 2.0 and Thread native support. It acts as the "Fake HomeKit Bridge" that allows
your Apple Watch to trigger Linux scripts via Siri without ever touching the cloud.
